The immediate neighborhood was previously an agricultural but currently turning into residential area with bigger agricultural parcels being subdivided into smaller plots of 1/8, 4 and 2 acre sizes to cater for increase demand for residential properties within the area. The area is currently characterized by undeveloped plots and a blend of Swahili type residential houses, modern bungalows and maisonettes mainly for owner occupier purposes. Ukunda township is largely propelled by the tourism sector and particularly Diani tourist circuit that host renowned beach hotels and villas. The economy of the town and its greater hinterland therefore depend on the performance of the tourism sector. The improvement of infrastructure in the area especially Dongo Kundu bypass has further opened the area. The typical residential sector within the town is stable. The local economy is generally vibrant and demand for land for residential development is anticipated to remain stable in the short and medium term. Demand for similar type of developments is modest as the subject market is predominantly build-to-own residential sector.",
