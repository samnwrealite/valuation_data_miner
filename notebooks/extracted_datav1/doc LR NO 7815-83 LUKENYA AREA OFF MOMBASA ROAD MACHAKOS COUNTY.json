However, this is changing giving way to a myriad of mixed-use developments comprising residential, commercial and industrial users. This has pushed property prices upwards. Demand for similar properties in the area is stable. We anticipate a lukewarm property market in the short and medium term due to the depressed economy that has been precipitated by the Covid 19 pandemic."
