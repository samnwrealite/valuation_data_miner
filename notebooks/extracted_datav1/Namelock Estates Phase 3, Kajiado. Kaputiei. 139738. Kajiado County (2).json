    "general_market_remarks": "This is a three-bedroom bungalow within the newly built Namelock Estate Phase 3 located within Kitengela Area of Kajiado County. The subject is attractively finished internally; externally rendered and yet to be colour-washed. The property is situated in a neighbourhood that is dominated by residential developments, with gated community concept being a popular feature within the area and its immediate environs. The increasing demand for residential land and properties has sparked a trend that has seen an influx of buyers to peripheral areas of the larger Nairobi Metropolitan area due to the relatively affordable prices. Currently, the local property market is lukewarm due to local economic challenges adversely affecting the demand for ptoperty across board. We however anticipate a continued but measuted growth in the sector going forward into the foreseeable future.",

To the best of our knowledge, the subject property is not government land and has not been reserved for public utility user. We confirm that the property is not listed in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes Volumes 1, 2 & 3. We further confirm that the land is not adversely mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC) Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526 of 22nd December 2017, 2032, and 2033 of 2nd March 2018 and 1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on riparian reserve /wetland. We were unable to confirm the allotment date or if the ptoper procedures were followed as we were not privy to this information.",

The current user of the property conforms to its stipulated use.",
    "environmental_issues": "There ate currently no other obvious visible environmental issues including contaminated land either on the subject or on an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the ptoperty. A detailed environmental impact assessment report would verify this in greater details.",
