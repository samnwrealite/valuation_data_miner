    "summary": "The subject property is situated in a developing agricultural area with reasonable accessibility. Due to a relatively inactive market, actual sales within the immediate neighborhood were difficult to obtain. The valuation has therefore relied on comparable data from neighboring areas and opinions of value gathered from local market agents. Comparable 1 offers KShs 600,000 per acre. Comparables 2, 3, and 4 indicate KShs 1,300,000 to 1,600,000 per acre. An adjusted value may fall in the range of KShs 800,000-1,100,000 per acre."
