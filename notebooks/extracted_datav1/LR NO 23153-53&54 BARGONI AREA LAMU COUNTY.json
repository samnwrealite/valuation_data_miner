The properties are accessible via an earth road branching off the main Hindi-Bargoni murram road.

While the region has faced security incidents in the past, the situation has significantly improved due to increased government presence and security apparatus, with further improvements anticipated.",

Any attempts at sale is expected to experience extended marketing and a prolonged sale period."
