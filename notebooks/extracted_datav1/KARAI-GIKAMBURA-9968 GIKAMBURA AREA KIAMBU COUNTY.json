    "general_remarks": "The immediate neighbourhood is characterised mainly with stand-alone residential developments and complementary social amenities. Infrastructural facilities are available in the neighbourhood. The sustained improvement of infrastructure across board has opened up areas that were hitherto considered fringe areas. Gikambura and the general Kikuyu area has benefited from such hence pushing property values up. However, due to the struggles in the local economy and by extension the global economy has adversely affected the demand for property leading to a dipped property market. A continued but measured growth in the sector is anticipated going forward into the foreseeable future."
