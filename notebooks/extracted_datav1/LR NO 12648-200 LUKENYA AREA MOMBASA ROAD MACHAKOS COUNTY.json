The property is accessible and in proximity to major toad networks and other social activities able to sustain any economic activities undertaken within the plot. The neighbourhood within which the subject property is located was hitherto agricultural. However, this is changing giving way to both commercial and industrial use along Mombasa Road with properties off this road opening up for residential use. Some industrial establishments within the vicinity of the properties include Brava Foods, Simba Cement, Golden Africa and Kenplastic Limited. Demand for similar properties in the area is stable. We anticipate a lukewarm property market in the short and medium term due to the depressed economy."
