    "general_remarks": "This is a 7-acre parcel of land located within Iten Township in Elgeyo Marakwet County. The property is located in proximity to a myriad infrastructural and social amenities within the township. Iten is the headquarters and largest town of Elgeyo Marakwet County. It primarily serves as an administrative center, hosting various government offices, and the main commercial center of the County. The town boasts essential services such as Iten County Referral Hospital, which serves as the main healthcare facility in the region, and St. Patrick's High School Iten. The demand for plots within the town is mainly driven by the continuous growth in population especially for residential purposes. There is also a notable level of speculative investment in land, as buyers anticipate future growth and infrastructure development in the area. Given its size and location, the subject parcel can be subdivided into smaller parcels for commercial/ residential use."
