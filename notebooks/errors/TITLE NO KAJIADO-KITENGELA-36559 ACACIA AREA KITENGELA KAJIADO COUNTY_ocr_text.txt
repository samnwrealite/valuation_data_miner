REMARKS:

Encumbrances

Registered against the title is a charge dated 16/6/2011 in
favour of Cooperative Bank of Kenya Limited to secure a
sum of KShs. 1,200,000.00.

We were unable to ascertain the rates payment status as at
the date of this valuation. We advise that the proprietor
provides details of this if any.

The title is held on a freehold interest hence not subject to
payment of land rent.

The parcel measures approximately zero point zero four
eight (0.048) of a hectare or zero point one one eight six
(0.1186) of an acre.

The plot is rectangular shaped of black cotton soils with a
gentle eastward slope whose boundaries are marked with
barbed wire.

Access into the property is open.

Mains electricity is available for connection to the
ptoperty. Water would be from a borehole Foul drainage
would be into a septic tank or a soak pit.

The immediate access road to the estate is earth-surfaced.

There were no structural improvements on the plot as at
the date of our valuation.

This is a residential property located within Acacia Area of
Kitengela in Kajiado County.

The plot has mixed brown and black cotton soils with a
fairly level terrain suitable for residential development.

The property is situated in a neighbourhood with access to
major infrastructure including a good network of roads and
other social amenities.

--- Page 7 ---
Title Number: Kajiado/Kitengela/36559, Acacia Area, Kitengela, Kajiado County

The area is predominately residential with pockets of
commercial and institutional properties.

Demand for similar properties within this neighbourhood
is steady amongst the middle-class demographic looking to
build single family dwellings.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for
public use/water catchment area. To the best of our
knowledge, the subject property is not government land
and has not been reserved for public utility user. We
confirm that the property is not listed in the Report of the
Commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes
Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely
mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC)
Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526
of 22nd December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March
2018 and 1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on
riparian reserve / wetland.

Planning, Highway and _ other Statutory
Considerations

In out opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of
or potential for change of use of the subject property or
those in the vicinity, which could materially affect the value
of the subject property in the past or in future. The current
user of the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or
on an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
ptoperty. A detailed environmental impact assessment
report would verify this in greater details.

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

Matrimonial Property

According to the Matrimonial Property Act 2013, Section
6 (1) (©), Matrimonial Property means ‘any other
immoveable or moveable property owned by both or
either spouse and acquired during the subsistence of the
matriage’. The property is solely registered in the name of
Jackson Kiio Kimeu; hence it is not a matrimonial

property.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if
placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing
buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is usually derived on similar principles
as those of the current market value but anticipating a
willing buyer-unwilling seller situation that most often
lead to the attainment of lower values/prices upon a
ptoperty’s liquidation.

However, we have adopted a value based on 75% of the
market value being the reserve price as recommended by
Land Act upon sale (auction) of any given property for

recovery purposes.

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have
relied on the following method of valuation:

Comparative Sales Method

This method is based on sales and/or properties for sale,
which ate similar to the subject property with due
allowance made for value affecting differences between

the subject property and the comparable property.
