GENERAL
REMARKS:

The title is held on a freehold interest hence not subject to
payment of land rent.

The plot extends to zero point two six one (0.261) of a
hectare or zero point six four five zero (0.6450) of an acre
approximately.

This is rectangular-shaped red soils plot with a slight
southward slope whose boundaries are marked by corner
beacons. Access into the property is open.

Mains electricity and water are available for connection to
the property. Kenyatta Road, which is the main road in the
neighbourhood 1s tat-surfaced.

There were no structural improvements on the plot as at the
date of our inspection.

This is a vacant plot located within Kimunyu area off
Kenyatta Road in Kiambu County.

The neighbourhood within which the property is
characterized by single-family dwelling units mainly set
within gated community estates. The subject plot could be
subdivided and utilized in a similar manner.

While the general economic outlook has been uncertain in
the recent past leading to a slow take-up of real estate, this
submarket has seen marginal growth in prices of land due to
an increasing demand by prospective homeowners.

The demand has been fuelled by an ever-increasing middle-
income demographic in the country in the last few years. We
foresee this trend continuing into the foreseeable future.

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for
public use/water catchment area. To the best of out
knowledge, the subject property is not government land
and has not been reserved for public utility user.

We confirm that the property is not listed in the Report of
the Commission of Inquiry into the IIllegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes
Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely
mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC)
Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526
of 22nd December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March
2018 and 1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on
riparian reserve/wetland.

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations
In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of
or potential for change of use of the subject property or
those in the vicinity, which could materially affect the value
of the subject property in the past or in future. The current
user of the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or
on an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
property. A detailed environmental impact assessment
report would verify this in greater details.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if
placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing
buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Title No: Ngenda/Kimunyu/1916, Kimunyu Area, off Kenyatta Road, Kiambu County

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is also derived on similar principles as
those of the current market value but anticipates a willing
buyer-unwilling seller situation. In this report, we have
adopted a value equivalent to 75% of the market value being

the minimum amount a property can be sold at in an auction
as tecommended by Land Act No. 6 of 2012.
