As at the date of our inspection, the building was in a fair

‘he property was unoccupied at the time of our inspection.
In its current state the building will require renovation works
including dislodging the defunct machinery, for it to be
functional.

This is a double-storey godown located in Makupa atea of
Mombasa County. The building is currently unoccupied.

The neighbourhood is characterised by a combination of
light industrial and commercial properties. There is a
growing trend around the neighbourhood where
industrial/commercial properties are undergoing
redevelopment to high-rise apartment buildings.

The demand for similar properties in this neighbourhood is
moderate either for use as light industrial/warehouse
facilities, offices or redevelopment to high-rise apartments.

There are currently no obvious environmental issues
including contaminated land either on the subject or on an
adjoining site that materially affect the value of the property.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said properties have not been set aside for
public use/water catchment area. To the best of our
knowledge, the subject properties are not government land
and has not been reserved for public utility user. We
confirm that the property is not listed in the Report of the
Commission of Inquiry into the TIlegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes
Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely
mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC)
Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526
of 22nd December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March
2018 and 1547 of 15th Februaty 2019. The land is not on
riparian reserve/wetland.

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations

In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of
ot potential for change of use of the subject properties or
those in the vicinity, which could materially affect the value
of the subject property in the past or in future. The current
user of the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There ate currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or
on an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
ptoperty. A detailed environmental impact assessment
report would verify this in greater details.

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have
relied on the following method(s) of valuation:

Comparative Sales Method

This method is based on sales and/or properties for sale,
which are similar to the subject property with due
allowance made for value affecting differences between the
subject property and the comparable property.

Depreciated Replacement Cost Approach

This method estimates value based on the value of the land
plus the depreciated cost of replacing the existing
development. As a basis for the estimate of the
replacement cost new, we have relied on comparable
building costs currently prevailing in the building industry.

Income Capitalisation Approach

This method estimates value based on the property’s
anticipated income from the perspective of a typical
investor in the market place.

The net operating income is capitalised by an appropriate
capitalization rate based on a reasonable expectation of
return on the investment appropriate to the market and the
rate of return investors would expect on net operating
income in order to invest in similar properties.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if
placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing
buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Mortgage Value

The mortgage value returned is on the basis of a percentage
of the market value. We have adopted 80% as the
appropriate percentage given the speculative nature of the
current property market coupled with the downward
pressure that is currently being experienced on property
Ptices.

11

--- Page 13 ---
Title No. Mombasa/Block XII/106 & 109-off Lumumba Road - Makupa Area - Mombasa County

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is also derived on similar principles as
those of the current market value but anticipates a willing
buyer-unwilling seller situation. In this report, we have
adopted a value equivalent to 75% of the market value being
the minimum amount a property can be sold at in an auction
as recommended by Land Act No. 6 of 2012.

Insurance Value

In arriving at the insurance value of the structural
improvements, we have considered the current replacement
cost of the building including professional fees and loss of
rent,
