The buildings are adequately finished and in a good state of repair and maintenance. Kapsoya Estate is a fully serviced estate with all the mains services available. While the immediate access road to the property is earth-surfaced, the property enjoys close proximity to all-weather roads within the neighbourhood such as the nearby Elgeyo Road. Other social amenities within the proximity include shopping malls, like Rupa’s Mall, schools and religious establishments. The residential market within Eldoret remains stable and continues to experience steady growth owing to the infrastructural improvements and a growing middle-income demographic. This has led to a sustained demand both rental and purchase, especially within established estates like Kapsoya.",
