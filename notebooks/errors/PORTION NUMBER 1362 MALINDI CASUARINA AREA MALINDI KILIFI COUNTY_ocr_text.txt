Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our
considered opinion that the said property has not been
set aside for public use/water catchment area. To the
best of our knowledge, the subject property is not
government land and has not been reserved for public
utility user. We confirm that the property is not listed in
the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the
Illegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu
Report) Annexes Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely
mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC)
Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017,
12526 of 22nd December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd

--- Page 11 ---
Portion Number 1362- Malindi, Kilifi County

March 2018 and 1547 of 15th February 2019. The land
is not on riparian reserve /wetland.

Planning, Highway and _ other Statutory
Considerations

In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect
of or potential for change of use of the subject property
or those in the vicinity, which could materially affect the
value of the subject property in the past or in future.
The current user of the property conforms to its
stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There ate currently no other obvious visible
environmental issues including contaminated land either
on the subject or on an adjoining site that materially
affect the value of the property.

Basis of Valuation:

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if
placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing
buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction,
after proper marketing and where the parties had acted
knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.

Mortgage Value

The mortgage value returned is on the basis of a
percentage of the market value. We have adopted 80%
as the standard recommended percentage in accordance
to regular practice.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is usually derived on similar
ptinciples as those of the current market value but
anticipating a willing buyer-unwilling seller situation
that most often lead to the attainment of lower
values/prices upon a propetty’s liquidation. However,
we have adopted a value based on 75% of the market
value being the teserve price as recommended by

10

--- Page 12 ---
Portion Number 1362- Malindi, Kilifi County

Kenyan Law upon sale/liquidation of any collateral for
recovery purposes.

Insurance Value

In arriving at the insurance value of the structural
improvements, we have considered the current
replacement cost of the building including professional
fees.

Valuation Methodology:

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have
relied on the following methods of valuation:

Comparable Method

This method is based on sales and/or properties for sale,
which are similar to the subject property with due
allowance made for value affecting differences between

the subject property and the comparable property.

Depreciated Replacement Cost Approach

This method estimates value based on the value of the
land plus the depreciated cost of replacing the existing
development. As a basis for the estimate of the
replacement cost new, we have relied on comparable
building costs currently prevailing in the building
industry.
