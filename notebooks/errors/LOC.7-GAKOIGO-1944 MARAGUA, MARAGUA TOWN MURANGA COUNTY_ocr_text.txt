GENERAL
REMARKS:

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

Loc.7/Gakoigo/1944, Maragua Town- Murang’a County

This is a single storey commercial building situated within
Maragua town in Muranga County.

The building is characterized as a banking facility, while the
neighbourhood is characterized with retail/wholesale
shops and other businesses.

Its location affords it good access and proximity to the
basic infrastructural and social amenities within the town.

The property was purposely built for banking purposes,
and the ideal tenant would be a financial institution.

We note that the property has not been occupied for some
time, and a condition survey may be required to determine
the extent of disrepair for subsequent renovation works.

Maragua town is often described as a "sleepy" or
"dormant" town, with challenges related to lack of
infrastructure, social amenities, and economic stagnation.
This has contributed to its relatively timid property market
that has negatively affected property prices within the

town.

There are currently no obvious environmental issues
including contaminated land either on the subject or on an
adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
property. A detailed environmental impact assessment
would however be required to verify this.

There was no evidence to suggest that this was once a
public utility plot or was once a road reserve.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated amount the property should
exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer
and a willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction
after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted
knowledgably, prudently and without compulsion.

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

Loc.7/Gakoigo/1944, Maragua Town- Murang’a County

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is usually derived on similar
ptinciples as those of the current market value but
anticipating a willing buyer-unwilling seller situation
that most often lead to the attainment of lower prices
upon a property’s sale.

A forced sale value of a property is therefore the
estimated price it would fetch in a situation where the
seller is compelled to sell quickly, often due to financial
distress or other urgent circumstances. This is typically
lower than the market value, as the buyer has leverage,
and the seller is under pressure to accept a lower offer

We have adopted a forced sale value that is 25% lower
than the market value of the subject property to reflect
the forced sale discount where the property is to be
disposed of under forced sale circumstances.

Insurance Value

In arriving at the insurance value of the structural
improvements, we have considered the current
replacement cost of the building including professional
fees. As a basis for the estimate of the replacement cost
new, we have relied on comparable building costs currently

prevailing in the building industry.

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have
relied on the following methods of valuation:

Market Comparable Method

This method is based on sales and/or properties for sale,
which ate similar to the subject property with due
allowance made for value affecting differences between

the subject property and the comparable property.

--- Page 10 ---
Loc.7/Gakoigo/1944, Maragua Town- Murang’a County

Depreciated Replacement Cost Approach

This method estimates value based on the value of the land
plus the depreciated cost of replacing the existing
development. As a basis for the estimate of the
replacement cost new, we have relied on comparable
building costs currently prevailing in the building industry.

Income Capitalization Approach

This method estimates value based on the property’s
anticipated income from the perspective of a typical
investor in the marketplace.

The net operating income is capitalized by an appropriate
capitalization rate based on a reasonable expectation of
return on the investment appropriate to the market and
the rate of return investors would expect on net operating
income in order to invest in similar properties.
