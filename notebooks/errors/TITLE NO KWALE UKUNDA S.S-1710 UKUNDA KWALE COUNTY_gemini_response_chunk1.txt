    "general_remarks": "This is a three bedroom all ensuite bungalow situated in the out skirts of Ukunda Township, Ukunda, Kwale County. The immediate neighborhood was previously an agricultural but currently turning into residential area with bigger agricultural parcels being subdivided into smaller plots of 1/8, 4 and 2 acre sizes to cater for increase demand for residential properties within the area. The area is currently characterized by undeveloped plots and a blend of Swahili type residential houses, modern bungalows and maisonettes mainly for owner occupier purposes. Ukunda township is largely propelled by the tourism sector and particularly Diani tourist circuit that host renowned beach hotels and villas. The economy of the town and its greater hinterland therefore depend on the performance of the tourism sector. The improvement of infrastructure in the area especially Dongo Kundu bypass has further opened the area. The typical residential sector within the town is stable. The local economy is generally vibrant and demand for land for residential development is anticipated to remain stable in the short and medium term. Demand for similar type of developments is modest as the subject market is predominantly build-to-own residential sector."

    "Mortgage Value: The mortgage returned is on the basis of a percentage of the market value. We have adopted 80% as the standard recommended percentage in accordance with regular practice.",
    "Forced Sale Value: The forced sale value is usually derived on similar principles as those of the current market value but anticipating a wiling buyer—unwilling seller situation that most often lead to the attainment of lower values/prices upon a property’s liquidation. However, we have adopted a value based on 75% of the market value being the reserve price as recommended by Kenyan Law upon sale/liquidation of any collateral for recovery purposes."
