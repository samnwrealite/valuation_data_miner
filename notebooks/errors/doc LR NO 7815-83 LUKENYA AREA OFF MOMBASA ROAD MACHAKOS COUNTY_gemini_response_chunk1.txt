Mains electricity and water are available for connection to the property. Foul drainage would be into a septic tank. The immediate access to the subject properties is earth surfaced branching off the tar-surfaced Mombasa Road. There were no structural improvements on the parcels as at the date of our inspection. This is a vacant parcel of land situated off Mombasa Road, within Lukenya Area of Machakos County. The property is accessible and in proximity to major road networks and other social activities to support any developments on the plot. The neighbourhood within which the subject property is located was hitherto agricultural. However, this is changing giving way to a myriad of mixed-use developments comprising residential, commercial and industrial users. This has pushed property prices upwards. Demand for similar properties in the area is stable. We anticipate a lukewarm property market in the short and medium term due to the depressed economy that has been precipitated by the Covid 19 pandemic. Land use is Mixed use.",
