GENERAL
REMARKS:

This is an irregular-shaped ted soils parcel with a fairly level
terrain whose boundaries are left open.

Access into the property is open.

Mains electricity is available for connection to the property.
Water would be from boreholes while drainage would be to
septic tanks.

The immediate access road to the subject properties is tar-

There were no permanent structural improvements on the

This is a 7-acte parcel of land located within Iten Township in
Elgeyo Marakwet County.

The property is located in proximity to a myriad infrastructural
and social amenities within the township.

Iten is the headquarters and largest town of Elgeyo Matakwet

hosting various government offices, and the main
commercial center of the County.

The town boasts essential services such as Iten County
Referral Hospital, which serves as the main healthcare facility
in the region, and St. Patrick's High School Iten.

The demand for plots within the town is mainly driven by the
continuous growth in population especially for residential
purposes. There is also a notable level of speculative
investment in land, as buyers anticipate future growth and
infrastructure development in the atea.

Given its size and location, the subject parcel can be subdivided
into smaller parcels for commercial/ residential use.
