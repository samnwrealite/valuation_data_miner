GENERAL

REMARKS: This is a three bedroom all ensuite bungalow situated in

The immediate neighborhood was previously an
agricultural but currently turning into residential area
with bigger agricultural parcels being subdivided into
smaller plots of 1/8, 4 and 2 acre sizes to cater for
increase demand for residential properties within the
area.

--- Page 9 ---
Title Number: Kwale/Ukunda S. S/1710, Ukunda, Kwale County

The area is currently characterized by undeveloped plots
and a blend of Swahili type residential houses, modern
bungalows and maisonettes mainly for owner occupier

purposes.

Ukunda township is largely propelled by the tourism
sector and particularly Diani tourist circuit that host
renowned beach hotels and villas. The economy of the
town and its greater hinterland therefore depend on the
performance of the tourism sector.

The improvement of infrastructure in the area especially
Dongo Kundu bypass has further opened the area.

The typical residential sector within the town is stable.
The local economy is generally vibrant and demand for
land for residential development is anticipated to remain
stable in the short and medium term.

Demand for similar type of developments is modest as
the subject market is predominantly build-to-own
residential sector.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our
considered opinion that the said property has not been set
aside for public use/water catchment area. To the best of
out knowledge, the subject property is not government
land and has not been reserved for public utility user.

We confirm that the property is not listed in the Report
of the Commission of Inquiry into the Ilegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes
Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely
mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC)
Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526
of 22nd December 2017, 2032, and 2033 of 2nd March
2018 and 1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on
riparian reserve / wetland.

We were unable to confirm the allotment date or if the
ptoper procedures were followed as we were not privy to
this information.

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

Title Number: Kwale/Ukunda S. $/1710, Ukunda, Kwale County

Planning, Highway and _ other Statutory
Considerations

In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect
of or potential for change of use of the subject property
or those in the vicinity, which could materially affect the
value of the subject property in the past or in future. The
current user of the property conforms to its stipulated
use.

Environmental Issues

Thete are currently no other obvious visible
environmental issues including contaminated land either
on the subject or on an adjoining site that materially affect
the value of the property. A detailed environmental
impact assessment report would verify this in greater

details.

Matrimonial Property:

According to the Matrimonial Property Act 2013, Section
6 (1) ©, Matrimonial Property means ‘any other
immoveable or moveable property owned by both or
either spouse and acquired during the subsistence of the
mattiage’. The property is solely registered in the name of
Solomon Mathenge Muya; we were unable to confirm
whether this is a matrimonial property.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if
placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing
buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction,
after proper marketing and where the parties had acted
knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.

Mortgage Value

The mortgage returned is on the basis of a percentage of
the market value. We have adopted 80% as the standard
recommended percentage in accordance with regular
practice.

--- Page 11 ---
Title Number: Kwale/Ukunda S. $/1710, Ukunda, Kwale County

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is usually derived on similar
principles as those of the current market value but
anticipating a wiling buyer—unwilling seller situation that
most often lead to the attainment of lower values/prices
upon a property’s liquidation. However, we have
adopted a value based on 75% of the market value being
the reserve price as recommended by Kenyan Law upon
sale/liquidation of any collateral for recovery purposes.

Insurance Value

In arriving at the insurance value of the structural
improvements, we have considered the current
replacement cost of the building including professional
fees.

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have
relied on the following methods of valuation:

Comparable Method

This method is based on sales and/or properties for sale,
which ate similar to the subject property with due
allowance made for value affecting differences between

the subject property and the comparable property.

Depreciated Replacement Cost Approach

This method estimates value based on the value of the
land plus the depreciated cost of replacing the existing
development. As a basis for the estimate of the
teplacement cost new, we have relied on comparable
building costs currently prevailing in the building
industry.
