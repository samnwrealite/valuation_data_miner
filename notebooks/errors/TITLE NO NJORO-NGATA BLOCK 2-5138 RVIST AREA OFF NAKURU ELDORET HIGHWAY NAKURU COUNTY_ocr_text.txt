and lying at approximately 9 kilometres from Nakuru town
centre.

The area is mainly an owner occupier residential area but
with vibrant development of hostels to serve the
neighbouring RVIST college. Demand for properties in this
area is good. We however note that the general property
market is lukewarm on the background of a dithering
economy.

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

We ate not aware of any factors that could negatively affect
the saleability of the property both in an open market and
forced sale situations.

The property is zoned for residential purposes. There was no
evidence to suggest that this property has been set aside for
use as public utility land or as a road reserve ot a wetland or
lying on a riparian reserve/ or categorized as irregularly/
illegally acquired in the Ndungu Report (Report of the
commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular Allocation
of Public Land).

At the time of our inspection, we observed no obvious
environmental challenges that would pose a threat to the
values stated. Nor was there any evidence found, of
contaminated land on the subject property that would
materially affect the value of the subject property in any

adverse way.

As per the Gazzette Notice No. 6862 of July 2017, the title
of the subject property has not been revoked by the National
Land Commission.

We were not able to ascertain whether the property is a
matrimonial property.

The market value is based on a blend of compatable method
and Cost (Contractors) method while the insurance value is
based on the re-construction cost in case of peril, exclusive
of loss of rent during the reconstruction period.
