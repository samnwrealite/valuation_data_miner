    "general_remarks": "This is a three-bedroom, 2 ensuite bungalow within Yamumbi area of Kapsaret in Eldoret. The property is situated in a neighbourhood that is dominated by residential developments and supporting commercial, institutional and recreational establishments. The demand for land in the neighbourhood has seen an upward trajectory in the recent years. This demand is fueled by the continued growth of Eldoret City and the relatively affordable land for development of standalone single-family residences. Currently, the local property market is recovering from various economic challenges that had adversely affected the demand for property across board. We anticipate a continued but measuted growth in the sector going forward into the foreseeable future. Public Utility User: We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered opinion that the said property has not been set aside for public use/water catchment area. To the best of our knowledge, the subject property is not government land and has not been reserved for public utility user. We confirm that the property is not listed in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Ilegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes Volumes 1, 2 & 3. We further confirm that the land is not adversely mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC) Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526 of 22nd December 2017, 2032, and 2033 of 2nd March 2018 and 1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on riparian resetve/wetland. Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations: In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of ot potential for change of use of the subject property or those in the vicinity, which could materially affect the value of the subject property in the past or in future. The current user of the property conforms to its stipulated use. Environmental Issues: There are currently no other obvious visible environmental issues including contaminated land either on the subject or on an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the ptoperty. A detailed environmental impact assessment report would verify this in greater details. Matrimonial Property: According to the Matrimonial Property Act 2013, Section 6 (1) (c), Matrimonial Property means “any other immoveable ot moveable property owned by both or either spouse and acquired during the subsistence of the marriage’. The property is solely registered in the name of Milcah Wangui Mbugua. We were unable to confirm with absolute certainty whether this is a matrimonial property. We advise that the registered proprietor provide material information to this effect."
