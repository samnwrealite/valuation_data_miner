Kajiado/Kaputiei North/139738-Hse Number 3 —- Namelock Estates Phase 3-Kajiado County

The property is situated in a neighbourhood that is dominated
by residential developments, with gated community concept
being a popular feature within the area and its immediate
environs.

The increasing demand for residential land and properties
has sparked a trend that has seen an influx of buyers to
peripheral areas of the larger Nairobi Metropolitan area due
to the relatively affordable prices.

Currently, the local property market is lukewarm due to local
economic challenges adversely affecting the demand for
ptoperty across board. We however anticipate a continued but
measuted growth in the sector going forward into the
foreseeable future.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for public
use/watet catchment area. To the best of our knowledge, the
subject property is not government land and has not been
reserved for public utility user. We confirm that the property
is not listed in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into
the Illegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu
Report) Annexes Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely mentioned
in the National Land Commission (NLC) Kenya Gazette
Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526 of 22nd
December 2017, 2032, and 2033 of 2nd March 2018 and
1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on riparian
reserve /wetland.

We were unable to confirm the allotment date or if the
ptoper procedures were followed as we were not privy to
this information.

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations
In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of or
potential for change of use of the subject property or those in
the vicinity, which could materially affect the value of the
subject property in the past or in future. The current user of
the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Kajiado/Kaputiei North/139738-Hse Number 3 —- Namelock Estates Phase 3-Kajiado County

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

Envitonmental Issues

There ate currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or on
an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
ptoperty. A detailed environmental impact assessment report
would verify this in greater details.

Matrimonial Property:

According to the Matrimonial Property Act 2013, Section 6
(1) (©), Matrimonial Property means ‘any other immoveable
ot moveable property owned by both or either spouse and
acquired during the subsistence of the marriage’. The
property is solely registered in the name of Rimpa Valley
Limited; hence it is not a matrimonial property.

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have relied
on the following method(s) of valuation:

Comparative Sales Method

This method is based on sales and/or properties for sale,
which are similar to the subject property with due allowance
made for value affecting differences between the subject
ptoperty and the comparable propetty.

Depreciated Replacement Cost Approach

This method estimates value based on the value of the land
plus the depreciated cost of replacing the existing
development. As a basis for the estimate of the replacement
cost new, we have relied on comparable building costs

currently prevailing in the building industry.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if placed
in the market on the valuation date on a willing buyer willing
seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Mortgage Value

The mortgage value returned is on the basis of a percentage of
the market value. We have adopted 80% as the standard
recommended percentage in accordance to regular practice.

--- Page 11 ---
Kajiado/Kaputiei North/139738-Hse Number 3 ~ Namelock Estates Phase 3-Kajiado County

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is usually derived on similar principles as
those of the current market value but anticipating a wiling
buyer-unwilling seller situation that most often lead to the
attainment of lower values/prices upon a propetty’s
liquidation.

However, we have adopted a value based on 75% of the
market value being the reserve price as recommended by Land
Act upon sale (auction) of any given property for recovery
purposes. The property is located in a convenient location that
is increasingly becoming popular with the middle class
demographic. In our opinion therefore we did not oversee any
major obstacles in disposing of the property in a forced sale.

Insurance Value
In artiving at the insurance value of the structural

improvements, we have considered the current replacement
cost of the building including professional fees and loss of rent.
