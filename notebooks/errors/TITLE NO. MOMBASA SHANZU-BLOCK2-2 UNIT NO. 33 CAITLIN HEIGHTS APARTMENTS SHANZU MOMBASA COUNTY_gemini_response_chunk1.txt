    "Market Value: The market value returned here below would be the expected/estimated realization price of the property if placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction, after proper marketing and where the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.",
    "Mortgage Value: The mortgage value returned is on the basis of a percentage of the market value. We have adopted 80% as the recommended standard percentage in accordance to regular practice.",
    "Forced Sale Value: The forced sale value is usually derived on similar principles as those of the current market value but anticipating a willing buyer-unwilling seller situation that most often lead to the attainment of lower values/prices upon a property’s liquidation. However, we have adopted a value based on 75% of the market value being the reserve price as recommended by Kenyan Law upon sale of properties for recovery purposes.",
    "Insurance Value: In arriving at the insurance value of the structural improvements, we usually consider the current replacement cost of the building including professional fees."
