Title No.: Kajiado/Dalalekutuk/14709, Kajiado County.

Encumbrances

in favour of I&M Bank Limited to secure a sum of Kshs.
18,500,000.00.

The parcel measures approximately eight point three one

(8.31) hectares or approximately twenty point five three
actes (20.53 actes)

Agricultural with potential for mixed use purposes.

This is an almost L-shaped black cotton soil parcel with
gentle southward slope whose boundaries are open.
Survey beacons delineate the property.

Access into the property is open.

Electricity is available at a distance south eastward of the
ptoperty while water is obtained from private boreholes
in the neighbourhood.

Waste disposal would be to septic tanks/ pit latrines.

Access roads from Namanga Road are either murram or
earth surfaced.

There wete no structural developments on the parcel at
the time of our inspection.

The parcel was covered by natural grass vegetation and
thorny shrubs.

The property was unoccupied. No signs of encroachment
were noted on the patcel.

This is a roughly twenty-acre agricultural parcel located in
Dalalekutuk registration section of Kajiado County.

The parcel is approximately 6.5 Kilometers off the
Namanga Highway.

--- Page 7 ---
Title No.: Kajiado/Dalalekutuk/14709, Kajiado County.

The neighbourhood is characterized by similar vacant
patcels of land with sparse and scattered physical
developments. Most parcels are being used as grazing
fields. There is however a future development potential
with large parcels being subdivided into disposable units.

The area is not connected with basic infrastructural
services such as water and electricity. The road network in
the immediate neighbourhood is still rudimentaty.

Land market in the neighborhood appear modest, the
area is common with large land holdings held for market
speculation and land banking.

The property market has been subdued in the
background of the depressed economy that seems to be
taking longer to recover. The economy has not been very
favorable to the property market with interest rates
remaining high and capital inflows to the sector
remaining low.

There are currently no developments or environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject
ptoperty or on an adjoining site that would materially
affect the value of the property.

We confirm that according to the readily available records
at the relevant authorities, the subject property has not
been set aside for public use or appears in the Ndung’u
report as irregularly acquired or allocated.

We were unable to determine if the property is
matrimonial.

Basis of Valuation

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if
placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing
buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

--- Page 8 ---
Title No.: Kajiado/Dalalekutuk/14709, Kajiado County.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is usually derived on similar
principles as those of the current market value but
anticipating a willing buyer-unwilling seller situation
that most often leads to the attainment of lower
values/prices upon a propetty’s auction.

However, we have adopted a value based on 75% of the
market value being the reserve price as recommended by
Kenyan Law upon foreclosure for recovery purposes.
