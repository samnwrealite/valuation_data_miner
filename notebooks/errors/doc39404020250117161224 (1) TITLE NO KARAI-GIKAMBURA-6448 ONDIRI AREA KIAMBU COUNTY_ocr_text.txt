GENERAL
REMARKS:

Title No: Karai/Gikambura/6448-Ondiri Area-Kiambu County

- Painting and decoration
- Fixtures and fittings
- Ceiling finishing to first floor

As at the date of our valuation, the main house was under
construction while the servant quarters was in a good state
of repair and decoration.

The main house was unoccupied as it was still under
construction. The servant quarter was occupied by the
caretaker.

This is a double-storey 4 bedroom all en-suite town house
under construction with a detached domestic staff quarter in
Ondiri area of Kiambu County.

We estimate the overall level of completion of the main
house at 85%.

The immediate neighbourhood is characterised mainly with
stand-alone residential developments and complementary
social amenities. Infrastructural facilities are available in the
neighbourhood.

The property market is subdued due to local and global
economic downtowns adversely affecting the demand for
ptoperty across board. We however anticipate a continued
but measured growth in the sector going forward into the
foreseeable future due to improving macroeconomic factors
such as falling interest and stable exchange rates which might
positively influence demand for real estate, especially for
first-time home buyers.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for
public use/water catchment atea. To the best of our
knowledge, the subject property is not government land
and has not been reserved for public utility user. We
confirm that the property is not listed in the Report of the
Commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes
Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

--- Page 11 ---
BASIS OF
VALUATION:

Title No: Karai/Gikambura/6448-Ondiri Area-Kiambu County

We further confirm that the land is not adversely
mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC)
Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526
of 22nd December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March
2018 and 1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on
riparian reserve/wetland.

Planning, Highway, and other — Statutory
Considerations

In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of
or potential for change of use of the subject property or
those in the vicinity, which could materially affect the value
of the subject property in the past or in future. The current
user of the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or
on an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
ptoperty. A detailed environmental impact assessment
report would verify this in greater details.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if
placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing
buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is also derived on similar principles as
those of the current market value but anticipates a willing
buyer-unwilling seller situation. In this report, we have
adopted a value equivalent to 75% of the market value being

the minimum amount a property can be sold at in an auction
as tecommended by Land Act No. 6 of 2012.

Insurance Value

In arriving at the insurance value of the structural
improvements, we have considered the current replacement
cost of the building including professional fees and loss of

rent.
