The property is situated approximately 700 meters off
Mombasa Road, 2.3 kilometres to the East of Greenpark
Estate and 2.5 kilometres due South of Lukenya Gateway
within Lukenya Atea of Machakos County.

sutvey plan F/R No. 507/87, and we ascertain that the
ground location of the property conforms to that on the map.

We are satisfied that the property described herein is the
subject of our valuation. A copy of the survey map has been
attached herein as an appendix.

THE PARCELS
AND SITE WORKS:

SERVICES:

IMPROVEMENTS:

GENERAL
REMARKS:

The parcel is rectangular in shape with black cotton soils and
with fairly level slope. The boundaries are marked by corner
beacons.

Mains electricity and water are available for connection to the
ptoperty. Foul drainage would be into a septic tank.

The immediate access to the subject properties is earth
sutfaced branching off the tar-surfaced Mombasa Road.

There were no structural improvements on the patcels as at
the date of our inspection.

This is a vacant parcel of land situated off Mombasa Road,
within Lukenya Area of Machakos County.

The property is accessible and in proximity to major toad
networks and other social activities to support any
developments on the plot.

The neighbourhood within which the subject property is
located was hitherto agricultural. However, this is changing
giving way to a myriad of mixed-use developments comprising
residential, commercial and industrial users. This has pushed
ptoperty prices upwards.

Demand for similar properties in the area is stable. We
anticipate a lukewarm property market in the short and
medium term due to the depressed economy that has been
ptecipitated by the Covid 19 pandemic.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for public
use/water catchment area. To the best of our knowledge, the
subject property is not government land and has not been
reserved for public utility user. We confirm that the
properties are not listed in the Report of the Commission of
Inquity into the Illegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land
(Ndungu Report) Annexes Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

We further confirm that the parcel of land is not adversely
mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC) Kenya
Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526 of 22nd
December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March 2018 and
1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on riparian
reserve / wetland.

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations
In out opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of or
potential for change of use of the subject property or those in
the vicinity, which could materially affect the value of the
subject property in the past or in future. The current user of
the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or on
an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
ptoperties. A detailed environmental impact assessment
report would verify this in greater details.

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have relied
on the following method(s) of valuation:

Comparative Sales Method

This method is based on sales and/or property for sale,
which are similar to the subject property with due allowance
made for value affecting differences between the subject
property and the comparable property.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if placed
in the market on the valuation date on a willing buyer willing
seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.
