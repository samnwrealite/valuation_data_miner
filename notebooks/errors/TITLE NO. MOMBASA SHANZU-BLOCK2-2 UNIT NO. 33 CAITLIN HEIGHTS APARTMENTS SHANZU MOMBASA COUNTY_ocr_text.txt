BASIS OF
VALUATION:

Environmental Issues

There ate curtently no other obvious visible
environmental issues including contaminated land either
on the subject or on an adjoining site that materially affect
the value of the properties. A detailed environmental
impact assessment report would verify this in greater
details.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if
placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing
buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction,
after proper marketing and where the parties had acted
knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion

Mortgage Value

The mortgage value returned is on the basis of a
percentage of the market value. We have adopted 80% as
the recommended standard percentage in accordance to
regular practice

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is usually derived on similar
principles as those of the current market value but
anticipating a willing buyer-unwilling seller situation that
most often lead to the attainment of lower values/prices
upon a property’s liquidation. However, we have adopted
a value based on 75% of the market value being the
reserve price as recommended by Kenyan Law upon sale
of properties for recovery purposes.

Insurance Value

In artiving at the insurance value of the structural
improvements, we usually consider the current
replacement cost of the building including professional
fees.

Title No. Mombasa/Bamburi Shanzu Block 2/2 Unit No. 33, Shanzu, Mombasa County

VALUATION
METHODOLOGy:

We however note that should an insurable cause occur,
where the whole property is destroyed, an alternative
apartment would have to be sought similar to the subject.

This would be at the current open market value of the
apattment. We have thus returned insurance value
equivalent to the open market value of the apartment

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have
relied on the following methods of valuation:

Comparable Method

This method is based on sales and/or properties for sale,
which ate similar to the subject property with due
allowance made for value affecting differences between
the subject property and the comparable property.

Income Capitalisation Approach

This method estimates value based on the propetty’s
anticipated income from the perspective of a typical
investor in the market place.

The net operating income is capitalized by an appropriate
capitalization rate based on a reasonable expectation of
return on the investment appropriate to the market and
the rate of return investors would expect on net operating
income in order to invest in similar properties.
