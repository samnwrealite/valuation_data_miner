The property market has remained subdued due to local
economic challenges that have adversely affected the
demand for property across board. We however anticipate a
continued but measured growth in the foreseeable future
due to improving macroeconomic factors such as falling
interest and stable exchange rates.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is out considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for
public use/water catchment area. To the best of our
knowledge, the subject property is not government land
and has not been reserved for public utility user. We
confirm that the property is not listed in the Report of the
Commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes
Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely
mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC)
Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526
of 22nd December 2017, 2032, and 2033 of 2nd Match
2018 and 1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on
riparian reserve/wetland.

Planning, Highway, and _ other Statutory
Considerations

In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of
ot potential for change of use of the subject property or
those in the vicinity, which could materially affect the value
of the subject property in the past or in future. The current
user of the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or
on an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
property. A detailed environmental impact assessment
teport would verify this in greater details.
