GENERAL
REMARKS:

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

L. R. 21096/175, Jaspara House Juja Town, Kiambu County

This is a mixed-use property located within Juja Town,
Kiambu County.

By virtue of its location, the property enjoys easy access
to a myriad of infrastructural services and social
amenities.

The neighborhood is developed with similar mixed-use
developments featuring commercial spaces and
residential units.

There was no evidence to suggest that this property has
been set aside for use as public utility land or as a road
reserve or a wetland/ or categorized as irregularly/
illegally acquired in the Ndungu Report (Report of the
commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land).

At the time of our inspection, we observed no obvious
environmental challenges that would pose a threat to the
values stated. Nor was there any evidence found, of
contaminated land on the subject property that would
materially affect the value of the subject property in any
adverse way.

The Valuation has been prepared on the basis of "Market
Value", which is defined as:

"The estimated amount for which an asset or liability
should exchange on the Valuation date between a willing
buyer and a willing seller in an arm's-length transaction,
after proper marketing and where the parties had each
acted knowledgeably, prudently and _ without
compulsion."

--- Page 11 ---
VALUATION
APPROACHES/
METHODOLOGY:

L. R. 21096/175, Jaspara House Juja Town, Kiambu County

The valuation represents the figure that would appear in
a hypothetical contract of sale at the valuation date. No
adjustment has been made to this figure for any expenses
of acquisition or realization - nor for taxation which
might arise in the event of a disposal.

No account has been taken of any mortgages, debentures
or other charge.

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have
relied on the following valuation approaches: -

Income Approach

This approach provides an indication of value by
converting future cash flows to a single current capital
value.

This approach is effectively based on discounting future
amounts of cash flow to present value.

In our report, it has been assumed that the property will
be operating on a stabilized level of growth indefinitely
ie. the property is a long-lived asset, and hence it was
therefore not necessary to consider an explicit forecast
period for the cash flows (rental income) that ordinarily
would prompt the typical net present value (discounted
cash flows) method for assets that are held for a definite
period. In this regard, we adopted the income
capitalization method.

Income Capitalization Method
This method estimates value based on the property’s

anticipated income from the perspective of a typical
investor in the marketplace.

10

--- Page 12 ---
L. R. 21096/175, Jaspara House Juja Town, Kiambu County

The net operating income is capitalized by an appropriate
capitalization rate based on a reasonable expectation of
return on the investment appropriate to the market and
the rate of return investors would expect on net
operating income in order to invest in similar properties.

Depreciated Replacement Cost Approach

This method estimates value based on the value of the
land plus the depreciated cost of replacing the existing
development.

As a basis for the estimate of the replacement cost new,
we have relied on comparable building costs currently
prevailing in the building industry.

The approach evaluates the subject property as 2
different assets; land valuation based on comparable
method and construction valuation based on the
depreciated replacement cost.

After estimating the current construction replacement
cost, we took into consideration the age of the
construction and applied the proper depreciation rate
based on the economic age of the construction as well as
its current condition. A developer (Owner) profit is then
added to the net depreciated value of the construction.

Our cost estimate analysis assumptions were based on the
current prevailing building costs. The status, condition,
quality and performance of all the construction’s
components had a direct impact in driving our estimates.

COMPLIANCE WITH
VALUATION
STANDARDS: The Valuation has been prepared in accordance with the

Kenya Valuation Standards 2021 (the Blue Book) which
incorporate the International Valuation Standards.

This Valuation is for the sole purpose of providing the
intended user with the valuer’s independent professional

as set out in this report. We have made various

The Property

Process plant and machinery, tenants’ fixtures and
specialist trade fittings have been excluded from our
Valuation.

Title, Tenure, Lettings, Planning, Taxation and

their lease agreements;

affect value;

Standards 2021.
