    "Market Value: The market value returned here below would be the expected/estimated realization price of the property if placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.",
    "Mortgage Value: The mortgage value returned is on the basis of a percentage of the market value. We have adopted 80% as the standard recommended percentage in accordance to regular practice.",
    "Forced Sale Value: The forced sale value is usually derived on similar principles as those of the current market value but anticipating a wiling buyer-unwilling seller situation that most often lead to the attainment of lower values/prices upon a propetty’s liquidation. However, we have adopted a value based on 75% of the market value being the reserve price as recommended by Land Act upon sale (auction) of any given property for recovery purposes.",
    "Insurance Value: In artiving at the insurance value of the structural improvements, we have considered the current replacement cost of the building including professional fees and loss of rent."
