The title is held on a freehold interest hence not subject to
payment of land rent.

Mains electricity is available for connection in the
neighbourhood.

drainage would be to a septic tank or pit latrine.

The immediate access road is earth surfaced.

This is a trapezoidal- shaped parcel of red soils with a
south-westwatd slope whose boundaries are marked by
survey beacons ot left open.

There were no structural improvements on the parcel as at
the date of our inspection.

This is a vacant parcel of land situated within Njiku area of
Kiambu County. It is about 1.2 kilometres off and to the
North of Limuru Road.

The area is characterized by a mixture of residential
developments and small scale farming. Thete is, however, a
growing trend of large agricultural parcels being subdivided
for residential use. The demand for residential land in this
neighbourhood is adequate. The demand is fuelled by the
proximity of infrastructure and social amenities within the
neighbourhood.
