  "market_assessment": {
    "general_remarks": "The subject property is an agricultural parcel located in the Sugutek area of Uasin Gishu County. It features a relatively flat terrain with red soil that is well-suited for crop cultivation. It is partly used for settlement hosting homesteads. The surrounding neighbourhood is predominantly agricultural, with both crop farming and livestock rearing being the primary economic activities. Infrastructure development in the area is modest, with most access roads being earth-surfaced. The tarmac road is approximately 7 kilometers away. Other basic social facilities such as schools are within the locality. The parcel hosts about three homesteads, evidence of occupation, a factor that may pose legal or logistical challenges at disposal. Disposing of the property under forced sale conditions may therefore be prolonged and potentially yield lower-than-expected proceeds. Demand for similar properties in the neighbourhood is modest as the property market is locally driven by the needs of the local population."
