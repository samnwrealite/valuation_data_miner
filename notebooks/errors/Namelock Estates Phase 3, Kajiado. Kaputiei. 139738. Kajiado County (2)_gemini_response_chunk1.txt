    "general_market_remarks": "This is a three-bedroom bungalow within the newly built Namelock Estate Phase 3 located within Kitengela Area of Kajiado County. The subject is attractively finished internally; externally rendered and yet to be colour-washed. The property is situated in a neighbourhood that is dominated by residential developments, with gated community concept being a popular feature within the area and its immediate environs. The increasing demand for residential land and properties has sparked a trend that has seen an influx of buyers to peripheral areas of the larger Nairobi Metropolitan area due to the relatively affordable prices. Currently, the local property market is lukewarm due to local economic challenges adversely affecting the demand for ptoperty across board. We however anticipate a continued but measuted growth in the sector going forward into the foreseeable future.",
