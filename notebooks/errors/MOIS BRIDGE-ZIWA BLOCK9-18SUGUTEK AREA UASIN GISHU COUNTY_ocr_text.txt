AREA:

REPORT AND VALUATION

The property was inspected for valuation on 25" June 2025.

The property is situated within Ziwa Ward, within Soi
Constituency in Uasin Gishu County.

The property lies approximately 7 kilometres off and to the
Southeast of Kitale- Cherangani Road, 2 kilometers to the
Southeast of Legebet Secondary School and 580 meters due
Northeast of Sugutek Primary School.

The Google Map co-ordinates 0°52'09.5"N 35°18'16.7"E
fall on the property. (See attached google map)

We have inspected the relevant sutvey maps, and in particular
Sheet 1 Moi’s Bridge/Ziwa Block 9 (Lemorungeny), and
confirm the subject property is situated on the ground as per
the plans.

We further confirm that to the best of our knowledge, the
property does not lie on a road reserve and has no public user
claims upon its title.

Tenure:
The title is held on a freehold interest.

Registered Owner:
The title is registered in the names of Elijah Kiprotich
Lelachei.

Encumbrances:
Registered against the title is a charge dated 21/11/2013 in
favour of Cooperative Bank of Kenya Limited to secure a sum

of KShs. 1,200,000.00.

The plot extends to one point four zero nine zero (1.490) of
hectares or three point six eight one eight (3.6818) acres
approximately.

OCCUPANCY:

GENERAL
REMARKS:

Mains electricity is connected to the property. We could not
ascertain the availability of piped water as at the date of our
inspection. Foul drainage is into a pit latrine.

The immediate access toad is earth surfaced; main feeder road
is murram surfaced while the tarmac Kitale- Cherangani Road
is about 7 kilometres away.

An irtegulat-shaped relatively flat red soils plot whose
boundaries are marked partly by hedges or left open.

Access is not defined/ open to the road frontage.

Note: We had limited access to the subject property during
out inspection. As such, the details of developments and
improvements thereon could not be fully substantiated. We
however note that there were three homesteads on the patcel
with most of the developments appearing to be of semi-
permanent construction and hence considered temporary and
subsequently ignored for purposes of this valuation.

This valuation report is therefore based on visual observations
from accessible points from the periphery of the parcel by the
Valuer, and secondary information. It should be interpreted
with this limitation in mind.

The homesteads appeated to be occupied at the time of our
inspection.

The subject property is an agricultural parcel located in the
Sugutek area of Uasin Gishu County.

It features a relatively flat terrain with red soil that is well-
suited for crop cultivation. It is partly used for settlement
hosting homesteads.

The surrounding neighbourhood is predominantly
agricultural, with both crop farming and livestock rearing
being the primary economic activities.

--- Page 7 ---
Title No: Moi’s Bridge/Ziwa Block 9 (Lemorungeny)/18-Sugutek Area-Uasin Gishu County

Infrastructure development in the area is modest, with most
access roads being earth-surfaced. The tarmac road is
approximately 7 kilometers away. Other basic social facilities
such as schools are within the locality.

The parcel hosts about three homesteads, evidence of
occupation, a factor that may pose legal or logistical challenges
at disposal. Disposing of the property under forced sale
conditions may therefore be prolonged and potentially yield
lower-than-expected proceeds.

Demand for similar properties in the neighbourhood is
modest as the property market is locally driven by the needs
of the local population.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for public
use/water catchment area. To the best of out knowledge, the
subject property is not government land and has not been
reserved for public utility user. We confirm that the property
is not listed in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into
the Illegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu
Report) Annexes Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely mentioned
in the National Land Commission (NLC) Kenya Gazette
Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526 of 22nd December
2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March 2018 and 1547 of 15th
February 2019. The land is not on riparian reserve/wetland.

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations
In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of or
potential for change of use of the subject property or those in
the vicinity, which could materially affect the value of the
subject property in the past or in future. The current user of the
ptoperty conforms to its stipulated use.

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

Environmental Issues

There ate currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or on
an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the property.
A detailed environmental impact assessment teport would
verify this in greater details.

Matrimonial Property:

According to the Matrimonial Property Act 2013, Section 6
(1) (c), Matrimonial Property means ‘any other immoveable
or moveable property owned by both or either spouse and
acquired during the subsistence of the marriage’. The property
is solely registered in the name of Elijah Kiprotich
Lelachei. We were unable to confirm whether this is a
matrimonial property.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if placed
in the market on the valuation date on a willing buyer willing
seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is also derived on similar principles as
those of the current market value but anticipates a willing
buyer-unwilling seller situation. In this report, we have
adopted a value equivalent to 75% of the market value being the
minimum amount a property can be sold at in an auction as
recommended by Land Act No. 6 of 2012.

Valuation Commentary

The subject property is situated in a developing agricultural area with reasonable
accessibility. While some comparable properties fall within the general vicinity, a number
of them are in more prime or better-serviced areas, commanding higher rates.

Due to a relatively inactive market, actual sales within the immediate neighborhood
were difficult to obtain. The valuation has therefore relied on compatable data from
neighboring areas and opinions of value gathered from local market agents familiar
with transactions in the broader region.

Comparable 1 offers the closest proximity in terms of location and suggests a base
value of KShs 600,000 per acre.
Comparables 2, 3, and 4 indicate higher market expectations in superior locations,
ranging from KShs 1,300,000 to 1,600,000 per acre.

Adjustment: Given that the subject is slightly less prime than these high-end comparables
but mote accessible than Comparable 1, a reasonable adjusted value may fall in the range
of KShs 800,000-1,100,000 per acre, depending on its topography, soil quality, and
development potential.

Conclusion
Based on the foregoing analysis, market conditions, and local market insights, we have

adopted a figure of KShs 800,000 per acre for the subject property.
