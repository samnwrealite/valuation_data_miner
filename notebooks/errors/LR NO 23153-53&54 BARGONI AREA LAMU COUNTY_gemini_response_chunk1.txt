The properties are accessible via an earth road branching off the main Hindi-Bargoni murram road. Bargoni is a semi-rural area characterized by expansive parcels of land, limited infrastructure, and sparse settlement. While the region has faced security incidents in the past, the situation has significantly improved due to increased government presence and security apparatus, with further improvements anticipated."
