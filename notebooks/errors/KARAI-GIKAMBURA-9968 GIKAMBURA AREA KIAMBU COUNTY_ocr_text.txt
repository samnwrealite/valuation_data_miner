described herein is located on the ground as represented
on the map.

GENERAL
REMARKS:

Title No: Karai/Gikambura/9968-Gikambura Area-Kiambu County

The plot extends to zero point zero nine three (0.093) of a
hectare or zero point two two nine eight (0.2298) of an acre
approximately.

This is a rectangular-shaped, red soils plot with a gentle slope
whose boundaries ate marked by corner beacons and a
stonewall of the adjoining property to one side.

Access into the property is open.

Mains electricity is available for connection to the property.
Water would be from a borehole. Foul drainage would be
into a septic tank. Immediate access road is earth surfaced.

There wete no structural improvements on the patcel as at
the date of our inspection.

This is a vacant residential property located within
Gikambuta area of Kiambu County.

The immediate neighbourhood is characterised mainly with
stand-alone residential developments and complementary
social amenities. Infrastructural facilities are available in the
neighbourhood.

The sustained improvement of infrastructure across board
has opened up areas that were hitherto considered fringe
areas. Gikambura and the general Kikuyu atea has benefited
from such hence pushing property values up.

However, we note that due to the struggles in the local
economy and by extension the global economy has adversely
affected the demand for property leading to a dipped
ptoperty market. We anticipate a continued but measured
gtowth in the sector going forward into the foreseeable
future.

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

Title No: Karai/Gikambura/9968-Gikambura Area-Kiambu County

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant sutvey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for
public use/water catchment area. To the best of our
knowledge, the subject property is not government land
and has not been reserved for public utility user. We
confirm that the property is not listed in the Report of the
Commission of Inquiry into the IIllegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes
Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely
mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC)
Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526
of 22nd December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March
2018 and 1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on
riparian reserve / wetland.

Planning, Highway, and other Statutory
Considerations

In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of
or potential for change of use of the subject property or
those in the vicinity, which could materially affect the value
of the subject property in the past or in future. The current
user of the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There ate currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or
on an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
ptoperty. A detailed environmental impact assessment
report would verify this in greater details.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if
placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing
buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

--- Page 8 ---
Title No: Karai/Gikambura/9968-Gikambura Area-Kiambu County

Mortgage Value

The mortgage value returned is on the basis of a percentage
of the market value. We have adopted 80% as the
appropriate percentage given the speculative nature of the
current property market coupled with the downward
ptessure that is currently being experienced on property
ptices.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is also derived on similar principles as
those of the current market value but anticipates a willing
buyer-unwilling seller situation. In this report, we have
adopted a value equivalent to 75% of the market value being
the minimum amount a property can be sold at in an auction
as recommended by Land Act No. 6 of 2012.

--- Page 9 ---
Title No: Karai/Gikambura/9968-Gikambura Area-Kiambu County

VALUATION

Based on the foregoing, we value the unexpired freehold interest in Title No:
Karai/Gikambura/6448, Gikambura Area, Kikuyu, Kiambu County free

from any encumbrances as at today’s date as follows: -

1. Current Market Value KShs. 7,000,000.00
(Kenya Shillings Seven Million)

2. Mortgage Value KShs. 5,600,000.00
