BASIS OF
VALUATION:

L.R. Numbers: 12648/204 & 205-Lukenya Area-Mombasa Road-Machakos County

The neighbourhood within which the subject properties are
located was hitherto agricultural. However, this has changed
giving way to both commercial and industrial use along
Mombasa Road with properties off this road opening up for
residential use. Some industrial establishments within the
vicinity of the properties include Brava Foods, Simba Cement,
Maisha Mabati Mills, Golden Africa and Kenplastic Limited.

Demand for similar properties in the area is stable. We
anticipate a lukewarm property market in the short and
medium term due to the depressed economy.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said properties have not been set aside for
public use/water catchment area. To the best of our
knowledge, the subject properties are not government land
and has not been reserved for public utility user. We confirm
that the properties are not listed in the Report of the
Commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular Allocation
of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes Volumes 1, 2 &
3,

We further confirm that the parcels of land are not adversely
mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC) Kenya
Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526 of 22nd
December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March 2018 and
1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on riparian
reserve /wetland.

Environmental Issues

There ate currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or on
an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
properties. A detailed environmental impact assessment
report would verify this in greater details.

Market Value

We note that this is a retrospective valuation with the date
of valuation being 30th April 2013. We have therefore taken
into consideration the market factors and conditions that were
prevailing as at the date of valuation in the determination of
the market values.

L.R. Numbers: 12648/204 & 205-Lukenya Area-Mombasa Road-Machakos County

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

The market values returned here below are therefore the
expected/estimated realization prices the properties would
have obtained if they were placed in the market on the date of
valuation on a willing buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s
length transaction.

In arriving at the market value of the properties, we have
relied on the Comparative Sales Method of valuation.

This method is based on sales and/or properties for sale,
which ate similar to the subject property(ies) with due
allowance made for value affecting differences between the
subject property(ies) and the comparable propetties.
