DESCRIPTION:

Title No. Longonot/Kijabe Block 9/53, Longonot, Nakuru County

Encumbrances
Unascertained

The parcel measures approximately twenty-eight-point
double three seven (28.337) hectares or approximately

The parcel is situated in an area where land has been

use, especially gated residential use.

Electricity
Mains electricity is available in the immediate
neighbourhood for connection

GENERAL
REMARKS:

Title No. Longonot/Kijabe Block 9/53, Longonot, Nakuru County

There were temporary structures on the portions of the
property as at the date of our valuation. These have been
ignored for the purposes of this valuation.

The temporary structures on-site are used as guard posts
for security personnel monitoring the property.

This is a seventy-acre parcel located in Longonot area
near Mt. Longonot within the larger Kedong Ranch
approximately two Kilometres west of Longonot
Shopping Centre in Nakuru County.

The immediate neighbourhood is predominantly an
agricultural zone characterized by sizeable grazing fields
with sparse and scattered physical developments.

The subject parcel is located near the Longonot Gate
Golf Resort, a pioneering proposed development in the
area. If successfully implemented, this project is expected
to catalyze similar developments, contributing to the
growth and transformation of the broader Longonot
region.

The larger neighbourhood constituting Naivasha is
dominated by horticultural and tourism activities.
Naivasha is a getaway resort town that benefits a lot
from its proximity to Nairobi City thus fueling its hotel
and hospitality industry.

The tourism industry is anchored on sites such as the
famous Hells Gate National Park, Mt Longonot
National Park, Lake Naivasha, numerous private
conservancies, and the general scenic views in the region.

The above has resulted in investments in high end hotels
and resorts, and vacation/holiday homes in Naivasha
particularly in areas surrounding the lake.

METHODOLOGY:

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

Title No. Longonot/Kijabe Block 9/53, Longonot, Nakuru County

Nevertheless, the continued dither in the economy has
affected the property market negatively in many
segments. Property prices have therefore stagnated or
experienced minimal growth in the past few years. This
is expected to sustain into the short and medium term.

Our valuation is on the basis of optimal use potential and
especially assumes planning and subdivision of the parcel
into residential parcels.

The approach of our valuation is Market value on optimal
use basis and assumes the estimated amount, which the
property should exchange as at the date of valuation,
between a willing buyer and a willing seller, in an arm’s
length transaction after proper marketing wherein the
parties involved each acted knowledgeably, prudently and
without compulsion.
