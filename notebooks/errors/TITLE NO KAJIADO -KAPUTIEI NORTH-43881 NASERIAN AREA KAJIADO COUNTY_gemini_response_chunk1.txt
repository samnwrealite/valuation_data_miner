  "property_description": "This is a flat rectangular shaped parcel of rocky black soils with natural grass and shrubs vegetation. The parcel extends to approximately 20.235 hectares or 50.0 acres. There were no physical boundaries marking its extent and no structural developments had been erected on the land at the time of inspection. The property was covered with natural grass and shrub vegetation.",

  "market_assessment": {
    "user": "Agricultural with potential for residential development.",
    "services": "Mains electricity is available for connection in the neighborhood. Water supply would be from boreholes. Drainage would be to septic tanks/soak pits. Access roads from Namanga Road are either murram or earth surfaced.",
    "general_remarks": "The area is characterized with sparse and scattered physical developments. There is however a potential for development, especially if the road networks were to be improved. Large parcels such as the subject are being subdivided into disposable units. The land market in the neighborhood is sluggish, the area is common with organized groups which hold large tracts of land for market speculations or land banking. The property is within the vicinity of the Kapiti Railway station. There was no evidence to suggest that the subject parcel has been set aside for public use such as a road bypass or reserve. Neither is the property on a wetland nor appears in the Ndung’u Report as irregularly acquired or allocated. We did not witness any signs of a possible encroachment on the land or squatters."
