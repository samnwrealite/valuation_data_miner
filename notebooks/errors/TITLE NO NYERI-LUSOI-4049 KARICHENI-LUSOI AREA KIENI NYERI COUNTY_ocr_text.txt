Title No.: Nyeri/Lusoi 4049, Karicheni- Lusoi Area, Kieni, Nyeri County

The property is situated at the foothills of Mt Kenya thus
receives adequate rain to sustain rainfed farming.

The dam within the property stores rainwater. Besides
farming, other real estate development options would
include setting up holiday homes, a resort, or a
recreational facility.

Lusoi Resort is within the neighborhood of the property.

Generally, demand for land for farming, development or
speculation has been strong in the area. We however note
that with the recent challenges in the wider economy the
ptoperty market has been experiencing a slowdown with
properties taking longer to dispose.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for
public use/water catchment area. To the best of our
knowledge, the subject property is not government land
and has not been reserved for public utility user. We
confirm that the property is not listed in the Report of
the Commission of Inquity into the Illegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes
Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely
mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC)
Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526
of 22nd December 2017, 2032, and 2033 of 2nd Match
2018 and 1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on
riparian reserve / wetland.

Planning, Highway, and other Statutory
Considerations

In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of
ot potential for change of use of the subject property or
those in the vicinity, which could materially affect the value
of the subject property in the past or in future. The current
user of the property conforms to its stipulated use.

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

Title No.: Nyeri/Lusoi 4049, Karicheni- Lusoi Area, Kieni, Nyeri County

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or
on an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
ptoperty. A detailed environmental impact assessment
report would verify this in greater details.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if
placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing
buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is also derived on similar principles as
those of the current market value but anticipates a willing
buyer-unwilling seller situation. In this report, we have
adopted a value equivalent to 75% of the market value
being the minimum amount a property can be sold at in an
auction as recommended by Land Act No. 6 of 2012.
