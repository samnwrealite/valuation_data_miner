Title No: Mavoko Mun Block 46/175/192-Apt No. 5-D2-1-New Rise Gardens -Syokimau Area-Machakos County

CONDITION:

GENERAL
REMARKS:

The apartment block was newly constructed in a good state of
repair and decoration. There were no obvious defects to the
ptoperty as at the time of our inspection.

This is a three-bedroomed 2-ensuite apartment within New
Rise Gardens in Syokimau area of Machakos County.

The fittings and finishes to the subject apartment are of good
quality.

The property enjoys easy access to basic infrastructure services
such as shopping, transport and other social facilities within
Syokimau area. It is within proximity to Gateway Mall, JKIA
and is less than 20 kilometres from Nairobi city centre.

Demand for similar units within the area has recorded growth
within the last few years owing to the growing middle-income
demographic, improvement of infrastructure, such as the
Nairobi Expressway, and relative affordability compared to
suburban areas closer to the city center.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for public
use/water catchment area. To the best of our knowledge, the
subject property is not government land and has not been
reserved for public utility user. We confirm that the property
is not listed in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into
the Illegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu
Report) Annexes Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely mentioned
in the National Land Commission (NLC) Kenya Gazette
Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526 of 22nd
December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March 2018 and
1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on riparian
reserve/wetland.

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations

--- Page 11 ---
Title No: Mavoko Mun Block 46/175/192-Apt No. 5-D2-1-New Rise Gardens -Syokimau Area-Machakos County

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

In our opinion we do not foresee any significant prospect of
ot potential for change of use of the subject property or those
in the vicinity, which could materially affect the value of the
subject property in the past or in future. The current user of
the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There ate currently no obvious and visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or on
an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the

property.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if placed
in the market on the valuation date on a willing buyer willing
seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is usually derived on similar principles as
those of the current market value but anticipating a willing
buyer-unwilling seller situation that most often lead to the
attainment of lower values/prices upon a property’s
liquidation.

However, we have adopted a value based on 75% of the
market value being the reserve price as recommended by Land
Act upon sale (auction) of property for recovery purposes.

Mortgage Value

The mortgage value returned is on the basis of a percentage of
the market value. We have adopted 80% as the standard
recommended percentage in accordance to regular practice.

Insurance Value

In arriving at the insurance value of the structural
improvements, we usually consider the current replacement
cost of the building including professional fees. We however
note that, should an insurable cause occur, where the whole
ptoperty is destroyed, an alternative flat would have to be
sought similar to the subject. This would be at the current
market value of the flat. We have thus returned insurance
value equivalent to the current market value of the apartment.

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have relied
on the following method(s) of valuation:

Comparative Sales Method

This method is based on sales and/or properties for sale,
which are similar to the subject property with due allowance
made for value affecting differences between the subject
property and the comparable property.

Income Capitalization Approach

This method estimates value based on the property’s
anticipated income from the perspective of a typical investor
in the marketplace.

The net operating income is capitalized by an appropriate
capitalization rate based on a reasonable expectation of
return on the investment appropriate to the market and the
tate of return investors would expect on net operating
income in order to invest in similar propetties.
