GENERAL
REMARKS:

The plot extends to zero point zero eight zero three (0.0803)
of a hectare or one point one nine eight four (0.1984) of an
acte.

This is a rectangular-shaped, black cotton soils plot with a
fairly flat gradient whose boundaries ate open or marked
with corner beacons. Access into the property is open.

Mains electricity and water are available for connection to
the property. Fowl drainage would be into a septic tank. The
immediate access road to the property is earth surfaced.

There were no permanent structural improvements on the
parcel as at the date of our inspection.

The property was unoccupied as at the time of our valuation.

This is a vacant parcel of land located within Happy Valley
Estate within Landless Area of Thika, Kiambu County.

The estate is predominantly characterized by standalone
residential housing.

Demand for residential land in the area is moderate. The
demand is driven by proximity to major infrastructure and
the relatively affordable prices of land compated to other
areas of Thika with close proximity to the town center.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is out considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for
public use/water catchment area. To the best of our
knowledge, the subject property is not government land
and has not been reserved for public utility user.

--- Page 7 ---
Thika Municipality Block 24/2069-Happy Valley Estate Landless Area-Kiambu County

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

We confirm that the property is not listed in the Report of
the Commission of Inquity into the Illegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes
Volumes 1, 2 & 3. We further confirm that the land is not
adversely mentioned in the National Land Commission
(NLC) Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017,
12526 of 22nd December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd
Match 2018 and 1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is
not on riparian reserve/wetland.

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations

In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of
ot potential for change of use of the subject property or
those in the vicinity, which could materially affect the value
of the subject property in the past or in future. The current
uset of the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or
on an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
ptoperty. A detailed environmental impact assessment
report would verify this in greater details.

Matrimonial Property:

According to the Matrimonial Property Act 2013, Section
6 (1) ©, Matrimonial Property means ‘any other
immoveable or moveable property owned by both or
either spouse or acquired during the subsistence of the
marriage’. The property is solely registered in the name of
Robert Leshau Gitau; hence it is not mattimonial

property.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if
placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing
buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Forced Sale Value

--- Page 8 ---
Thika Municipality Block 24/2069-Happy Valley Estate Landless Area-Kiambu County

The forced sale value is also derived on similar principles as
those of the curtent market value but anticipates a willing
buyer-unwilling seller situation. In this report, we have
adopted a value equivalent to 75% of the market value being
the minimum amount a property can be sold at in an auction
as recommended by Land Act No. 6 of 2012.
