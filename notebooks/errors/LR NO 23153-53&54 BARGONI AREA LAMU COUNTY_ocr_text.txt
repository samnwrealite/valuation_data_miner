GENERAL
REMARKS:

Encumbrances:
Registered against each title is a charge dated 31/10/2022 in
favour of KCB Bank Kenya Limited to secure a sum of

KShs. 10,320,000.00 (with other lands).

Each parcel measures approximately twenty point two four
(20.24) hectares or fifty point zero one two (50.012) of an
acte.

Mains electricity is available for connection in the
neighbourhood. Water would be from a private borehole
while foul drainage would be to a septic tank or pit latrine.
The immediate access toad is earth-surfaced.

These are rectangular-shaped sandy soils plots with fairly
level gradients whose boundaries are marked corner
beacons. Access into the properties is open.

There were no permanent structural improvements on the
parcels as at the date of our inspection.

These are two 50-acre parcels of land located within the
larger Bargoni Area of Lamu County.

The properties are accessible via an earth road branching
off the main Hindi-Bargoni murtam road. Mains electricity
is available in the area for connection to the subject parcels.

Bargoni is a semi-rural area characterized by expansive
patcels of land, limited infrastructure, and sparse
settlement. While the region has faced security incidents in
the past, the situation has significantly improved due to
increased government presence and security apparatus,
with further improvements anticipated.

--- Page 8 ---
L.R Nos 23153/53 & 54 (I.R No: 52890 & 52889), Bargoni Area, Lamu County

The local property market is relatively slow, with demand
primarily driven by speculative holdings and agricultural
use. Property prices have remained stable, with minimal
investor activity in recent years. However, this is expected
to improve as the LAPSSET Corridor project stimulates
gtowth in the region. Currently, transactional volumes
remain modest, and there is negligible rental demand for
vacant land.

The subject parcels are speculative holdings within a slow-
moving market with modest demand. Their appeal lies in
their prospects for future growth driven by improving
infrastructure. Under forced sale circumstances, a
significant discount is expected on the market value due to
liquidity issues, delayed development prospects and
locational challenges. Any attempts at sale is expected to
expetience extended marketing and a prolonged sale

period.

We confirm that the properties have not been previously set
aside for public use nor does it lie on a road reserve or a
wetland/ or categorised as itregularly/ illegally acquited in
the Ndungu Report (Report of the commission of Inquity
into the Illegal/Trregular Allocation of Public Land).

There ate currently no developments or environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject
properties or on an adjoining site that would materially
affect the value of the properties.

Basis of Valuation

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if
placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing
buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is usually derived on similar
ptinciples as those of the current market value but
anticipating a willing buyer-unwilling seller situation that
most often leads to the attainment of lower values/prices
upon a property’s liquidation.

--- Page 9 ---
L.R Nos 23153/53 & 54 (I.R No: 52890 & 52889), Bargoni Area, Lamu County

However, we have adopted a value based on 75% of the
market value being the reserve price as recommended by
Land Act No. 6 of 2012 upon sale of properties for
recovery purposes.

Note: Due to the property-specific issues highlighted in
out General Remarks, the actual realizable forced sale
ptices might be lower than the recommended 75%. We
advise that the Bank take cognizance of these factors when
setting the final reserve price based on its internal risk
assessment and disposal policies.

Valuation Methodology:

In our appraisal of market value hereunder, we have made
use of the market approach (Sales comparison) method. This
method is based on sales and/or properties for sale, which
ate similar to the subject property with due allowance made
for value affecting differences between the subject property
and the comparable property.
