  "market_assessment": {
    "general_remarks": "This is an incomplete residential property situated in RVIST area, Nakuru County, near all social and economic amenities and lying at approximately 9 kilometres from Nakuru town centre. The area is mainly an owner occupier residential area but with vibrant development of hostels to serve the neighbouring RVIST college. Demand for properties in this area is good. We however note that the general property market is lukewarm on the background of a dithering economy. We are not aware of any factors that could negatively affect the saleability of the property both in an open market and forced sale situation"
