GENERAL
REMARKS:

This is a three-bedroom, 2 ensuite bungalow within Yamumbi
area of Kapsaret in Eldoret.

The property is situated in a neighbourhood that is dominated
by residential developments and supporting commercial,
institutional and recreational establishments.

The demand for land in the neighbourhood has seen an
upward trajectory in the recent years. This demand is fueled
by the continued growth of Eldoret City and the relatively
affordable land for development of standalone single-family
residences.

Currently, the local property market is recovering from various
economic challenges that had adversely affected the demand
for property across board. We anticipate a continued but
measuted growth in the sector going forward into the
foreseeable future.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for public
use/water catchment area. To the best of our knowledge, the
subject property is not government land and has not been
reserved for public utility user. We confirm that the property
is not listed in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into
the Ilegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu
Report) Annexes Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely mentioned
in the National Land Commission (NLC) Kenya Gazette
Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526 of 22nd
December 2017, 2032, and 2033 of 2nd March 2018 and
1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on riparian
resetve/wetland.

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations
In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of ot
potential for change of use of the subject property or those in
the vicinity, which could materially affect the value of the
subject property in the past or in future. The current user of
the property conforms to its stipulated use.

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or on
an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
ptoperty. A detailed environmental impact assessment report
would verify this in greater details

Matrimonial Property:

According to the Matrimonial Property Act 2013, Section 6
(1) (c), Matrimonial Property means “any other immoveable
ot moveable property owned by both or either spouse and
acquired during the subsistence of the marriage’. The
property is solely registered in the name of Milcah Wangui
Mbugua. We were unable to confirm with absolute
certainty whether this is a matrimonial property. We advise
that the registered proprietor provide material information
to this effect.

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have relied
on the following method(s) of valuation:

Comparative Sales Method

This method is based on sales and/or properties for sale,
which are similar to the subject property with due allowance
made for value affecting differences between the subject
property and the comparable property.

Depreciated Replacement Cost Approach

This method estimates value based on the value of the land
plus the depreciated cost of replacing the existing
development. As a basis for the estimate of the replacement
cost new, we have relied on comparable building costs
currently prevailing in the building industry.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if placed
in the market on the valuation date on a willing buyer willing
seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

--- Page 11 ---
Title No: Kapsaret/Kapsaret Block 1 (Yamumbi)/1855-Yamumbi Area, Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County

Mortgage Value

The mortgage value returned is on the basis of a petcentage of
the market value. We have adopted 80% as the standard
recommended percentage in accordance to regular practice.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is usually derived on similar principles as
those of the current market value but anticipating a willing
buyer-unwilling seller situation that most often lead to the
attainment of lower values/ptices upon a propetty’s
liquidation.

However, we have adopted a value based on 75% of the
market value being the reserve price as recommended by Land
Act upon sale (auction) of any given property for recovery

purposes.

Insurance Value

In arriving at the insurance value of the structural
improvements, we usually consider the current replacement
cost of the building including professional fees and cost of
alternative accommodation.

VALUATION

Kapsaret/Kapsaret Block 1 (Yamumbi)/1855-Yamumbi Area- Kapsaret-Uasin
Gishu County, free from any encumbrances as at today’s date as follows: -

1) Current Market Value KShs. 5,600,000.00
