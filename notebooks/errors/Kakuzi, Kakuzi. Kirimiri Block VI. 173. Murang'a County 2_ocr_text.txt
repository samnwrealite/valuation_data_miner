GENERAL
REMARKS:

Kakuzi/Kitimiri Block Vi/173-Kakuzi Atea-Murang’a County

This is a trapezoidal-shaped, red soils plot with a southwards
slope whose boundaries are open or fronting a seasonal
river. Access into the property is open.

Mains electricity and water are available for connection to
the property. Fowl drainage would be into a septic tank. The
immediate access road to the property is earth surfaced.

Thete were temporaty structures on the parcel, which have
been ignored for the purposes of this valuation.

This is a vacant agricultural parcel located within Kakuzi area
of Murang’a County.

The property is located in the Kakuzi area, which 1s
predominantly characterized by crop farming and single-
family homesteads. There is adequate infrastructure within
the neighborhood to support agricultural activities within
the area.

The demand for agricultural land in this sub-market is
average. The demand is fueled by proximity to water
soutces for agticulture as well as the soil types, which
supports the cultivation of different varieties of crops.
However, the topography of the subject plot, being slightly
steep, could discourage potential buyers due to difficulties
in cultivating the land.

Public Utility User

We have petused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for
public use/water catchment area. To the best of our
knowledge, the subject property is not government land
and has not been reserved for public utility user. We
confirm that the property is not listed in the Report of the
Commission of Inquity into the  Illegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes
Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely
mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC)
Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526
of 22nd December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

Kakuzi/Kirimiti Block Vi/173-Kakuzi Area-Murang’a County

2018 and 1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on
riparian reserve/wetland.

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations

In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of
or potential for change of use of the subject property or
those in the vicinity, which could materially affect the value
of the subject property in the past or in future. The current
uset of the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or
on an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
property. A detailed environmental impact assessment
report would verify this in greater details.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if
placed in the market on the valuation date on a willing
buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is also derived on similar principles as
those of the current market value but anticipates a wzling
buyer—unnilkng seller situation. In this report, we have adopted
a value equivalent to 75% of the market value being the
minimum amount a property can be sold at in an auction as
recommended by Land Act No. 6 of 2012.
