  "property_description": "The plot extends to zero point zero nine three (0.093) of a hectare or zero point two two nine eight (0.2298) of an acre approximately.

Mains electricity is available for connection to the property. Water would be from a borehole. Foul drainage would be into a septic tank. Immediate access road is earth surfaced. There were no structural improvements on the parcel as at the date of our inspection. This is a vacant residential property located within Gikambura area of Kiambu County. The immediate neighbourhood is characterised mainly with stand-alone residential developments and complementary social amenities. Infrastructural facilities are available in the neighbourhood.",

    "general_remarks": "The immediate neighbourhood is characterised mainly with stand-alone residential developments and complementary social amenities. Infrastructural facilities are available in the neighbourhood. The sustained improvement of infrastructure across board has opened up areas that were hitherto considered fringe areas. Gikambura and the general Kikuyu area has benefited from such hence pushing property values up. However, due to the struggles in the local economy and by extension the global economy has adversely affected the demand for property leading to a dipped property market. A continued but measured growth in the sector is anticipated going forward into the foreseeable future."
