OCCUPANCY:

GENERAL
REMARKS:

The property was occupied by a tenant as at the time of our
inspection. We estimate the gross market rent in the range
of KShs. 30,000.00-40,000.00.

This is 3-bedroom master en-suite bungalow with a detached
extension having 2 No. one-bedroom units in Kapsoya Estate,
about 4 kilometres from Eldoret CBD, Uasin Gishu county.

The buildings are adequately finished and in a good state of
repait and maintenance.

Kapsoya Estate is a fully serviced estate with all the mains
services available. While the immediate access road to the
property is earth-surfaced, the property enjoys close proximity
to all-weather roads within the neighbourhood such as the
neatby Elgeyo Road. Other social amenities within the
ptoximity include shopping malls, like Rupa’s Mall, schools
and religious establishments.

The residential market within Eldoret remains stable and
continues to experience steady growth owing to the
infrastructural improvements and a growing middle-income
demographic. This has led to a sustained demand both rental
and purchase, especially within established estates like
Kapsoya.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for public
use/water catchment area. To the best of our knowledge, the
subject property is not government land and has not been
reserved for public utility user. We confirm that the property
is not listed in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into
the Illegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu
Report) Annexes Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely mentioned
in the National Land Commission (NLC) Kenya Gazette
Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526 of 22nd
December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March 2018 and
1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on riparian
resetve/wetland.

Eldoret Municipality/Block 9/983, Kapsoya Estate, Eldoret City, Uasin Gishu County

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations
In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of or
potential for change of use of the subject property or those in
the vicinity, which could materially affect the value of the
subject property in the past or in future. The current user of
the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or on
an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
property. A detailed environmental impact assessment report
would verify this in greater details.

Matrimonial Property

According to the Matrimonial Property Act 2013, Section 6
(1) (c), Matrimonial Property means ‘any other immoveable
or moveable property owned by both or either spouse and
acquired during the subsistence of the marriage’. The
ptoperty is registered in the names of Johnson Mwangi
Muiga and Jane Waithira Mwangi, hence it is a
matrimonial home.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if placed
in the market on the valuation date on a willing buyer willing
seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is usually derived on similar principles as
those of the current market value but anticipating a wz/ling
buyer-unwiling seller situation that most often lead to the
attainment of lower values/prices upon a property’s
liquidation.

However, we have adopted a value based on 75% of the
market value being the reserve price as recommended by Land
Act upon sale (auction) of property for recovery purposes.

--- Page 11 ---
Eldoret Municipality/Block 9/983, Kapsoya Estate, Eldoret City, Uasin Gishu County

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have relied
on the following method(s) of valuation:

Comparative Sales Method

This method is based on sales and/or properties for sale,
which are similar to the subject property with due allowance
made for value affecting differences between the subject
property and the comparable property.

Depreciated Replacement Cost Approach

This method estimates value based on the value of the land
plus the depreciated cost of replacing the existing
development. As a basis for the estimate of the replacement
cost new, we have telied on comparable building costs
currently prevailing in the building industry.
