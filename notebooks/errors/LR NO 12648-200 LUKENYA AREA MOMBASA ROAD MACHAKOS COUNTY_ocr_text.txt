GENERAL
REMARKS:

The plot extends to approximately two point zero zero zero
(2.000) hectares or four point nine four two (4.942) actes.

Agricultural.

The parcel is near level and rectangular in shape with mixed
soils whose boundaries are marked by corner beacons.

The parcel fronts Mombasa Road.

Mains electricity and water are available for connection to
the property. Foul drainage would be into septic tank.

The immediate access to the subject property is the tar-
sutfaced, Mombasa Road.

There were no structural improvements on the parcel as
on the date of our inspection.

This a vacant parcel of land situated along Mombasa Road,
within Lukenya Area of Machakos County.

The property is accessible and in proximity to major toad
networks and other social activities able to sustain any
economic activities undertaken within the plot.

The neighbourhood within which the subject property is
located was hitherto agricultural. However, this is changing
giving way to both commercial and industrial use along
Mombasa Road with properties off this road opening up
for residential use. Some industrial establishments within
the vicinity of the properties include Brava Foods, Simba
Cement, Golden Africa and Kenplastic Limited.

Demand for similar properties in the area is stable. We
anticipate a lukewarm property market in the short and
medium term due to the depressed economy.

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

L.R. Number: 12648/200, Lukenya Area, Mombasa Road, Machakos County

We reiterate that this valuation is a retrospective one and
the value returned is as of 30 April 2013.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the property was not and has not been set
aside for public use/water catchment area. To the best of
our knowledge, the subject property is not government
land and has not at any given time been reserved for
public utility user.

We confirm that the property is not listed in the Report
of the Commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes
Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the parcel of land is not adversely
mentioned in the National Land Commission (NLC)
Kenya Gazette Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526
of 22nd December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March
2018 and 1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on
riparian reserve / wetland.

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or
on an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
property. It has been assumed that the status quo existed as
of 30° April 2013.

Market Value

We note that this is a retrospective valuation with the
date of valuation being 30th April 2013. We have therefore
taken into consideration the market factors and conditions
that were prevailing as at the date of valuation in the
determination of the market value.

The market value returned here below is therefore the
expected/estimated realization price the property would
have obtained as at 30th April 2013 if it were placed in the
market on a willing buyer willing seller basis at an arm’s
length transaction.
