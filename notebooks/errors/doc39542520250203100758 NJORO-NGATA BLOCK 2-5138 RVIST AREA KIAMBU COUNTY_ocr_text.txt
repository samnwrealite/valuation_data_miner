In our estimation, the main building is approximately 40%
complete as per the specifications. The following works had
been done as at the time of our inspection.

- Setting out and clearance

- Excavation of trenches

- Fixtures and fittings

The property is not occupied.

This is an incomplete residential property situated in RVIST
atea, Nakuru County, near all social and economic amenities
and lying at approximately 9 kilometres from Nakuru town
centre.

The area is mainly an owner occupier residential area but
with vibrant development of hostels to serve the
neighbouring RVIST college. Demand for properties in this
atea is good. We however note that the general property
market is lukewarm on the background of a dithering
economy.

We ate not aware of any factors that could negatively affect
the saleability of the property both in an open market and
forced sale situation

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for public
use/water catchment area. To the best of our knowledge, the
subject property is not government land and has not been
reserved for public utility user. We confirm that the property
is not listed in the Report of the Commission of Inquiry into
the Illegal/Irregular Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu
Report) Annexes Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely mentioned
in the National Land Commission (NLC) Kenya Gazette
Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526 of 22nd
December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March 2018 and
1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on riparian
reserve /wetland.

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations
In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of or
potential for change of use of the subject property or those in
the vicinity, which could materially affect the value of the
subject property in the past or in future. The current user of
the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or on
an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
property. A detailed environmental impact assessment report
would verify this in greater details.

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

Matrimonial Property:

According to the Matrimonial Property Act 2013, Section 6
(1) (c), Matrimonial Property means ‘any other immoveable
ot moveable property owned by both or either spouse and
acquited during the subsistence of the marriage’. The
property is solely registered in the name of Joash Naman
Ochieng. We were not able to confirm whether this is a
matrimonial property. We advise that the registered owner
provide this information.

The market value is based on a blend of comparable method
and Cost (Contractors) method while the insurance value is
based on the re-construction cost in case of peril, exclusive
of loss of rent during the reconstruction period.
