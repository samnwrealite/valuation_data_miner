The atea is mainly an owner occupier residential area but

area is good. We however note that the general property
market is lukewarm on the background of a dithering
economy.

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

We are not aware of any factors that could negatively affect
the saleability of the property both in an open market and
forced sale situations.

The property is zoned for residential purposes. There was no
evidence to suggest that this property has been set aside for
use as public utility land or as a toad reserve or a wetland or
lying on a riparian reserve/ or categorized as irregularly/
illegally acquired in the Ndungu Report (Report of the
commission of Inquiry into the Illegal/Irregular Allocation
of Public Land).

At the time of our inspection, we observed no obvious
environmental challenges that would pose a threat to the
values stated. Nor was there any evidence found, of
contaminated land on the subject property that would
materially affect the value of the subject property in any
adverse way.

As per the Gazzette Notice No. 6862 of July 2017, the title
of the subject property has not been revoked by the National
Land Commission.

We were not able to ascertain whether the property is a
matrimonial propetty.

The market value is based on a blend of comparable method
and Cost (Contractors) method while the insurance value is
based on the re-consttuction cost in case of peril, exclusive
of loss of rent during the reconstruction period.
