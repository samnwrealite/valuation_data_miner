This is a one-acre agricultural property located within
Chepkanga area of Uasin Gishu County.

Access to the property is granted by an unnamed murram toad

by ted soils and a fairly flat topography allowing for a range of
agricultural activities.

The property is located in an area characterised by extensive
agticultural practises due to its proximity to good transport
network, fertile soils and adequate rain fall.

However, the subject area is within the prescinds of Eldoret
City and hence transitioning from agricultural to residential
cum commercial use. University of Eldoret is in the vicinity
