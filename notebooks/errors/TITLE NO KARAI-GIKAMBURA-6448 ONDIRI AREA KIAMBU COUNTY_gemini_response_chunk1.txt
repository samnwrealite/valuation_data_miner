We estimate the overall level of completion of the main house at 85%. The immediate neighbourhood is characterised mainly with stand-alone residential developments and complementary social amenities. Infrastructural facilities are available in the neighbourhood. The property market is subdued due to local and global economic downtowns adversely affecting the demand for ptoperty across board. We however anticipate a continued but measured growth in the sector going forward into the foreseeable future due to improving macroeconomic factors such as falling interest and stable exchange rates which might positively influence demand for real estate, especially for first-time home buyers.",
