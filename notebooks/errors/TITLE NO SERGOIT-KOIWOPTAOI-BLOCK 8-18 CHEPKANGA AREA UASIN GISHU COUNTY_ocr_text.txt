REMARKS:

terrain whose boundaries are marked with barbed wire on
timber posts.

Access into the subject property is via frontage to the various
road frontages to the property.

Mains electricity is connected to the property. We opine that
water is obtained from boreholes and drainage to septic
tanks /latrines.

The immediate access roads to the subject consist of the tar-
sutfaced Eldoret-Iten Road and 2 No. murram-surfaced
roads.

Erected on the plot are various permanent and temporary
structures. The developments have been ignored in our
valuation.

We could not verify the occupancy status of the property as
at the date of our valuation.

This is a 98-acre agricultural property located within
Chepkanga area of Uasin Gishu County.

Access to the property is granted by Eldoret-Iten Road and
additional murram-surfaced roads. The parcel is characterised
by ted soils and a fairly flat topography allowing for a range of
agricultural activities.

The area has extensive agricultural practises due to its
proximity to good transport network, fertile soils and adequate
rainfall. The parcel therefore has great potential for large scale
commercial farming given its size that easily allow for
mechanization.

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

We however note that the subject area is within the prescinds
of Eldoret City and hence transitioning from agricultural to
residential cum commercial use. Large parcels are therefore
being subdivided into small plots that are more valuable and
relatively easy to dispose of.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for public
use/water catchment area. To the best of our knowledge, the

1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on riparian
reserve /wetland.

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations

potential for change of use of the subject property or those in
the vicinity, which could materially affect the value of the
subject property in the past or in future. The current user of
the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or on
an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
ptoperty. A detailed environmental impact assessment report
would verify this in greater details.
