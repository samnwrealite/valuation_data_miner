The real estate market is currently experiencing a slowdown
that has affected all properties across boatd. Properties are
taking a bit longer to dispose with prices thawing. We prospect
that the current trend will change in the foreseeable future
subject to economic growth.

Public Utility User

We have perused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for public
use/water catchment atea. To the best of our knowledge, the
subject property is not government land and has not been
reserved for public utility user.

We confirm that the property is not listed in the Report of
the Commission of Inquity into the IIlegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land (Ndungu Report) Annexes
Volumes 1, 2 & 3.

We further confirm that the land is not adversely mentioned
in the National Land Commission (NLC) Kenya Gazette
Notice No. 6862 of 17th July 2017, 12526 of 22nd
December 2017, 2032 and 2033 of 2nd March 2018 and
1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on riparian
reserve/wetland.

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations
In our opinion we don’t foresee any significant prospect of or
potential for change of use of the subject property or those in
the vicinity, which could materially affect the value of the
subject property in the past or in future. The current user of
the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There are currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or on
an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
property. A detailed environmental impact assessment report
would verify this in greater details.

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

Matrimonial Property:

According to the Matrimonial Property Act 2013, Section 6
(1) (c), Matrimonial Property means ‘any other immoveable
or moveable property owned by both or either spouse and
acquired during the subsistence of the matriage’. The
property is solely registered in the name of Co-operative
Bank Housing Co-operative Society Limited; hence this
is not a matrimonial property.

Market Value

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if placed
in the market on the valuation date on a willing buyer willing
seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Mortgage Value

The mortgage value returned is on the basis of a petcentage of
the market value. We have adopted 80% as the standard
recommended percentage in accordance to regular practice.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is usually derived on similar principles as
those of the current market value but anticipating a wélling
buyer-unmiling seller sitaation that most often lead to the
attainment of lower values/prices upon a propetty’s
liquidation.

However, we have adopted a value based on 75% of the
market value being the reserve price as recommended by
Kenyan Law upon sale (auction) of any given property for

recovety purposes.

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have relied
on the following method(s) of valuation:

Comparative Sales Method

This method is based on sales and/or properties for sale,
which are similar to the subject property with due allowance
made for value affecting differences between the subject
property and the comparable property.
