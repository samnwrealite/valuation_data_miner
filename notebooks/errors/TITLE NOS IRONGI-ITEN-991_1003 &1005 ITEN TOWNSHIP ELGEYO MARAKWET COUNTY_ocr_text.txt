GENERAL
REMARKS:

Note: The plots measurements are as per a list provided
to us by the client.

These ate mostly rectangular-shaped red soil plots with fairly
level terrains whose boundaries are variously marked by
building lines, temporary fences or open.

Access into the properties is open.

Mains electricity is connected or available for connection to
the properties. We were unable to confirm the source of
water and the connectivity of sewer lines to the property.

The immediate access roads to the subject properties ate tar-
surfaced or earth-surfaced.

There were various permanent and temporary structures on
the parcels as at the date of our inspection. These have been
ignored in our valuation.

The developed properties were under various uses. We were
unable to verify the legality of the occupants/users.

These are one eighth-acre plots located within Iten Township
in Elgeyo Marakwet County.

The plots are located in proximity to a myriad social and
infrastructural facilities within the township.

Iten is the headquarters and largest town of Elgeyo Marakwet
County. It primarily serves as an administrative center,
hosting vatious government offices, and the main
commercial center of the County.

The town boasts essential services such as Iten County
Referral Hospital, which serves as the main healthcare facility
in the region, and St. Patrick's High School Iten.

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

The demand for plots within the town is mainly driven by the
continuous gtowth in population especially for residential
putposes. There is also a notable level of speculative
investment in land, as buyers anticipate future growth and
infrastructure development in the area.

Public Utility User

We have petused relevant survey plans; it is our considered
opinion that the said property has not been set aside for public
use/water catchment atea. To the best of our knowledge, the

December 2017, 2032, and 2033 of 2nd March 2018 and
1547 of 15th February 2019. The land is not on riparian
reserve/wetland.

Planning, Highway and other Statutory Considerations

potential for change of use of the subject property or those in
the vicinity, which could materially affect the value of the
subject property in the past or in future. The current user of
the property conforms to its stipulated use.

Environmental Issues

There ate currently no other obvious visible environmental
issues including contaminated land either on the subject or on
an adjoining site that materially affect the value of the
property. A detailed environmental impact assessment report
would verify this in greater details.
