Title Nos. Shawa/ Gicheha Block 4/697 & 698 (Kangakinga) - Sobea, Nakuru County

REMARKS:

BASIS OF
VALUATION:

These are two prime residential plots located on the north-
western sprawl of Sobea shopping centre, that is 15.5
kilometres from Nakuru town and within Nakuru’s
commuter zone.

The area is suitable for both commercial and residential users
and is accessible to all basic infrastructural, social and
economic amenities.

The area is mainly an owner occupier residential area wile
plots fronting the highway portend a commercial nature.

We ate not aware of any factors that could negatively affect
the saleability of the property both in an open market and
forced sale situations.

There was no evidence to suggest that this property has been
set aside for use as public utility land or as a road reserve or a
wetland or lying on a riparian reserve/ or categorized as
irregularly/ illegally acquired in the Ndungu Report (Report
of the commission of Inquiry into the Ilegal/Irregular
Allocation of Public Land).

At the time of our inspection, we observed no obvious
environmental challenges that would pose a threat to the
values stated. Nor was there any evidence found, of
contaminated land on the subject property that would
materially affect the value of the subject property in any
adverse way.

As per the Gazzette Notice No. 6862 of July 2017, the title
of the subject property has not been revoked by the National
Land Commission.

We were not able to ascertain whether the property is a
matrimonial property.

Market Value

--- Page 8 ---
Title Nos. Shawa/ Gicheha Block 4/697 & 698 (Kangakinga) - Sobea, Nakuru County

VALUATION
METHODOLOGY:

The market value returned here below would be the
expected/estimated realization price of the property if placed
in the market on the valuation date on a willing buyer willing
seller basis at an arm’s length transaction.

Mortgage Value

The mortgage value returned is on the basis of a percentage of
the market value. We have adopted 80% as the standard
recommended percentage in accordance to regular practice.

Forced Sale Value

The forced sale value is usually derived on similar principles as
those of the current market value but anticipating a willing
buyer-unwilling seller situation that most often lead to the
attainment of lower values/prices upon a property’s
liquidation.

However, we have adopted a value based on 75% of the
market value being the reserve price as recommended by Land
Act upon sale (auction) of any given property for recovery

purposes.

In arriving at the market value of the property, we have
relied on the following method of valuation:

Comparative Sales Method

This method is based on sales and/or properties for sale,
which are similar to the subject property with due allowance
made for value affecting differences between the subject
property and the comparable property.
